The assignment is divided in 7 phases.

Phase 1) It was developed a "token finder" using the FLEX tool to implement regex and find the possible tokens of a "C-like" language.

Phase 2) After parsing (lexical validation) it necessary to verify if the syntax is correct, if the tokens are set in expected sentences of the language, this was achieved by using the bison tool in this phase.
